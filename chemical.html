    <h1>What are the chemicals in smoking?</h1>
    <div class="line"></div>
    <div class="chemical_content">
    <p>More than 7,000 harmful chemical compounds are found in cigarette smoke and out of which 70 chemicals are known to be cancer-causing
         chemicals. Smoking harms nearly every organ in the body. Even if some people don't inhale tobacco smoke, they still absorb harmful
          chemicals through the lining of their mouths.</p>
    <br>
    <p>These harmful chemicals can damage the human body in many ways. For example,</p>
    <br>
    <p>1.	Nicotine - An addictive substance that raises blood pressure, increases heart rate and constricts blood vessels. This can</p>
    <p>•	damage your heart by forcing it to work faster and harder.</p>
    <p>•	slow your blood and reduce oxygen to your feet and hands.</p>
    <p>2.	Tar - A sticky substance that coats your lung and contains cancer-causing substances (carcinogens). It damages the cilia
         (a tiny hair-like structures which is responsible for keeping our airways clean) and allows all toxins to travel freely into the lungs
          causing many lung diseases including lung cancer. It can also cause oral health problems.</p>
    <p>3.	Carbon Monoxide - A poisonous gas that reduces the blood's ability to carry oxygen, putting strain on the heart and other organs.
         Over time, airways swell up and let less air into the lungs.</p>
    <p>4.	Formaldehyde- A toxic chemical that can cause cancer, respiration, stroke, and other health problems.</p>
    <p>5.	Benzene - A chemical that can cause blood cancer and other blood disorders as long-term benzene exposure may cause DNA 
        abnormalities that control the development of blood cells in bone marrow.</p>
    <p>6.	Arsenic - A toxic heavy metal leads to various health issues, including cardiovascular and certain types of cancer.</p>
    <p>7.	Acetone - A chemical, if inhaled or swallowed in high amounts over a short period can cause respiratory problems and
         can contribute to lung damage.</p>
    <p>8.	Ammonia - A toxic gas that irritates the respiratory system and contributes to the addictive properties of nicotine.</p>
    <p>9.	Hydrogen Cyanide - A poisonous gas released on burning tobacco that can interfere with the body's ability to use oxygen
         properly and has been linked to various health problems.</p>
    <p>10.	Phenols - A chemical that paralyses and kills the hair-like cells in your airways. These cells sweep clean the lining of airways
         and protect them against infections. Exposure to phenol may irritate the skin, eyes, nose, throat, and nervous system.</p>
    <p>11.	Tiny particles in tobacco smoke irritate the throat and lungs and cause a "smoker's cough". This makes the human body produce
         more mucus and damages lung tissue.</p>
    <p>12.	Cancer-causing chemicals make your cells grow too fast or abnormally. This can result in cancer cells.</p>
    <br>
    <p>These are just a few examples of harmful chemicals. The combination of these chemicals increases the risk of various health diseases,
         including heart diseases, various types of cancers, respiratory diseases, and other serious health issues.</p>
