                <p>Purpose - Raising awareness about tobacco smoking addiction and the harmful effects of smoking on an individual
                     and society due to the release of toxic chemicals from tobacco smoke.
                     It is a preventable behaviour and quitting is possible.</p>
                <p>Objective - To improve public health by preventing smoking-related premature death, motivate people to quit smoking
                     or not to start smoking in the first place, and contribute towards a smoke-free society.</p>
                <p style="font-size: 17.15px; color: rgb(200, 15, 255);">Tobacco smoking is one of the largest preventable causes of death
                     and diseases in Australia. 
                    Smoking rates in Australia have been declining over the years, but it still remains a significant public health issue.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 30px;">Do you know</p>
            <p>·   	One in ten adults were current daily smokers in 2021-22 (10.1%) shows that smoking is still prevalent.</p>
            <p>·   	It is estimated that nearly 3200 kids and teens start smoking their first cigarette every day.</p>
            <p>·    The total cost of smoking in Australia on society is estimated to be around AUD 137 billion.</p>
            <p>·   	Research shows that watching 5 minutes can help people to quit smoking if they are trying to quit but in a dilemma.</p>
            <p>·   	If a person quits smoking today his body will start to recover within 20 minutes and in 15 years his body 
                will be as good as a non-smoker. </p>
